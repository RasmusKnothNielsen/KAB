Repository for our 3. semester Design exam project. Computer Science, KEA.

##Definition of project
For our 3. semester Softwaredesign exam, we did a project in which we collaborated with a customer.\
In this collaboration, we had to deliver a working prototype and an 35-50 page hand-in.

Because this is an Softwaredesign exam, our focus is on the design process and ensuing overall quality.\


This projects main concern, is to make people more aware of how much CO2 emission is related to daily streaming.\
Through this awareness, our customer hopes to inspire customers to demand cleaner streamingservices, CO2 emission-wise.
